  In any discussion of design systems there will be a certain amount of insider jargon. The term “design system” is itself a bit of insider jargon.

  Here we’ll try to set definitions of common terms so we can all refer to things by the same names.

<h4>Design System</h4>

<p>A design system comprises the entirety of guidelines, assets, and resources for producing websites in a specific style or brand identity. It includes a style guide, a pattern library of examples, and the actual assets – fonts, graphics, CSS frameworks, JavaScript libraries – needed to create websites.</p>

<h4>Style guide</h4>

<p>A set of guidelines for creating media in a particular style. This includes brand elements, color palette, typography, and copywriting.</p>

<p>A style guide can also refer to a set of standards for formatting code.</p>

<h4>Design Pattern</h4>

<p>In software engineering, a design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem. In the context of front-end web development, a design pattern can take the form of a reusable bundle of markup and CSS that establishes a template for structuring and styling commonly occuring types of content.</p>

<p>For example, a website might have lots of forms. There are many ways to structure a form in HTML and style it with CSS, but within a complex system it can be beneficial to establish a design pattern for forms to ensure consistency and relieve developers of solving the same problem over and over for every new form they create.</p>

<h4>Pattern Library</h4>

<p>A collection of common design patterns. These are reusable snippets of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, visual examples for reference, and documentation about how to use them.</p>

<h4>Atomic Design</h4>

<p>As coined by [Brad Frost](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/table-of-contents/), ”atomic design is a methodology for creating design systems.” It consists of breaking a web page down into its smallest component parts, which can then be combined and assembled in different configurations, adding more parts in increasing complexity to arrive at the complete page.</p>

<p>Using chemistry as a metaphor, Brad names these collections of parts “atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages.”

<h4>Atom</h4>

<p>Atoms are the smallest part of a web page, usually corresponding to a single HTML element. A single link, a single heading, a single button, and so on.</p>

<h4>Molecule</h4>

<p>A small assemblage of atoms that, combined, form a basic functional piece of an interface. This might be a heading with a paragraph, a heading with an image and a link, a link with an icon, a form field with a label, a form field with a label and a button, etc. Single elements by themselves rarely do much, but a few elements combined can serve a more meaningful purpose.

<h4>Organism</h4>

<p>A complete and distinct chunk of the interface that should be able to stand on its own and function independently in any template. These are the reusable building blocks of a web page. Examples:</p>

<ul class="prose">
    <li>A page intro with headline, subheading, hero image, and call to action link.</li>
    <li>A signup form with headline, several form fields with labels, and a submit button.</li>
    <li>A brand masthead with logo, tagline, and navigation.</li>
    <li>A footer with navigation links, copyright info, and a language selector.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Template</h3>

<p>An arrangement of components (organisms, molecules, and atoms) that form a complete web page. The template is the skeleton supporting the final, polished page, so it doesn't necesarily include final content or visual design. Different pages may share a common template with the same basic structure but with different modules, content, and presentation.</p>

<h3>Page</h3>

<p>A web page is a page on the web, even though ”page” is mostly a useful metaphor. Where a “template” is the modular structure under a page, when we refer to the page as a whole we’re talking about the complete experience: structure, content, design, imagery, and behavior. A page is built upon a template composed of organisms made up of molecules assembled from atoms.</p>
